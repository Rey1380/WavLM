# WavLM
***Speaker Verification by using WavLM model***<br/>
We used 30 speakers from Farsdat dataset to evaluate WavLM model in speaker verification task. <br/>
We chose 10 speakers for test as unknowns and the rest of speakers as known(target/untarget). <br/>Each speaker has 10 audio files.
We used the first audio file as Enrollment file.<br/>
After that we evaluated the performance of our model by calculating useful criteria for our model performance evaluation.
