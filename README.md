***Speaker Verification by WavLM model***<br/>
We use 30 speakers from Farsdat dataset to evaluate WavLM model in speaker verification task. <br/>
We choose 10 speakers for test as unknowns and the rest of speakers as known(target/untarget). <br/>Each speakers has 10 audio files.
We use the first audio file as Enrollment file.<br/>
After that we evaluate the performance of our model by calculating useful criteria for our model performance evaluation.
